					<h1 class="card-title">About this course</h1>
					<p>The Big Data Applications and Analytics course is an overview course in Data Science and covers the applications and technologies (data analytics and clouds) needed to process the application data. It is organized around rallying cry: Use Clouds running Data Analytics Collaboratively processing Big Data to solve problems in X-Informatics.</p>
					<h1 class="card-title">Learning outcomes</h1>
					<p>Students will gain broad understanding of Big Data application areas and approaches used. This course is a good preparation for any student likely to be involved with Big Data in their future.</p>
					<h1 class="card-title">Dr. Geoffrey Fox</h1>
					<p>Professor Geoffrey Fox received a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University and is now Professor of Informatics and Computing as well as Physics at Indiana University, where he is director of the Digital Science Center and Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies at the School of Informatics and Computing. He previously held positions at Caltech, Syracuse University and Florida State University.<br><br>He has published around 1,000 papers in Physics and Computer Science, supervised the PhD candidacies of 65 students, and received an h-index of 67 along with over 23000 citations. Professor Fox currently works in applying Computer Science to Bioinformatics, Sensor Clouds, Earthquake and Ice-sheet Science, and Particle Physics. He is principal investigator of FutureGrid â€“ a facility to enable development of new approaches to computing. He is involved in several projects, including the eHumanity portal, to enhance the capability of Minority Serving Institutions. A Fellow of APS and ACM, he has experience in online education and its use in MOOCs for areas like Data and Computational Science.</p>
